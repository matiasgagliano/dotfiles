## Set up

- Change login shell to Zsh:

  # Installs tmux globally as root or locally for non-root users
  sh ~/dofiles/extra/scripts/install_tmux_from_src.sh
  ```

- Install patched icon font for Vim's statusline:

  Copy `~/dotfiles/extra/files/iconsolata_for_powerline.otf`
  to the fonts folder and run `fc-cache -v -f`, or run
  `sh ~/dofiles/extra/scripts/install_vim_statusline_font`.

- Map `Caps Lock` to `Esc` key:

  Copy `~/dotfiles/extra/files/70-custom-keyboard-mappings.hwdb`
  into `/etc/udev/hwdb.d`.

- When using `pkgfile`, enable its `systemd` timer to automatically
  synchronize the files database:

  systemctl enable --now pkgfile-update.timer
  ```
